 - Upgraded codebase to work with DZil 4.
 - New support for build/test/config/recommends phases.
 - Now dies and leaves you in the tempdir if it manages to generate  a
   fubared Makefile.PL
 - Now using Latest Role::Tempdir
 - General overhaul of everything.
 - This release hopefully resolves rt #55840 ( reported by Salve J. Nilsen
   )
 - This now ships its own default test-runner.
 - Attempted support at supporting scripts via :ExecFiles
 - More errors moved to occur in the dzil phase, not in the templater  (
   which suppresses sneaky errors that I had happening because the code in
   the templates were dying, and emitting "hurp, something failed" into the
   template, which, being perl code, wasn't too great )
 - Emitted Makefile.PL has more comments explaining whats happening.
 - Injects a "Hey, don't modify this file!" warning.
